Freds Phasers Mod
=======================

adds 3 "Phaser" blocks. Blocks can be rotated by a screwdriver up until the point they are first used. Next you point the circle end of the block at what ever you want to "phase". The low power phaser will do a 3x3x3 in front of it, the med power will do 5x5x5 and the high power will do 7x7x7. Once you are ready, apply a redstone signal to the block. It will remove a cube worth of blocks from the game.  Every time you toggal the redstone, it will scan what is in front of it and store it, whilst placing down what it had stored.  It is fully compatable with all vanilla tile entitys, and there is no reason (that i can think of) that would make it now work with modded TE's. It can even phase other phaser blocks (that have phased yet more blocks).  Use a pickaxe to break it when you are done.
